<h1>USB stick based firmware update</h1>


<h2>What is this function for?</h2>
<p>The USB stick based firmware feature allows preparing a USB stick
that contains a firmware update to be applied by the charge controller.
The stick is placed into a charge controller. The charge controller detects the 
update file, applies it and reboots the charge controller to make 
the changes take effect. </p>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

<h3>Place password file on USB stick</h3>
<p> To ensure that a person with access to the USB port of the charge controller 
actually is authorized to make configuration changes, the USB stick needs to 
contain a file named USB_PASSWORD in the root folder that contains either the 
operator or manufacturer password. If such a file does not exist, no firmware 
update is applied.</p>


<h3>Place sw_update.deb file onto USB stick</h3>
<p>In addition the USB stick should a file sw_update.deb in the 
root folder. This should contain the firmware update that you have received from 
the manufacturer of the charge controller or charging station.</p> 
<p> Please only apply firmware updates that have been approved by the 
manufacturer of the product that you have purchased. Downgrades are not 
possible and are rejected by the feature.</p>


<h3>Insert stick into charge controller to apply</h3>
<p> When the stick is inserted the controller will signal by blinking with all 
front LEDs that the SW update is detected and about to be installed. After applying the parameter
changes the controller will reboot automatically. After the reboot when no 
further changes can be applied from the stick, the controller will signal that 
by blinking quickly with the ready LED.</p>

<h2>How to disable it?</h2>
<p> This parameter allows disabling this feature. If disabled, no sw updates are 
accepted via USB even if the correct password file is present.</p>
