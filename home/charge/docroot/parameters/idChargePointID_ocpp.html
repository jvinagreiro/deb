<h1>ChargePointID or ChargeBoxIdentity</h1>

<p> This parameter is necessary for OCPP based communication with the backend 
system. Its exact use differs depending on the specific version and variant of 
OCPP in use. The parameter length is limited to 128 characters.</p>

<h2>OCPP-S 1.5 and OCPP-S 1.6</h2>
<p> In SOAP based OCPP messages the standard defines a SOAP header element called 
chargeBoxIdentity. This element must be set in every message from a charger to a
backend system to identify the charging station from which the message was 
received. This parameter is used to fill this SOAP header element in SOAP based
OCPP. </p>

<h2>OCPP-J 1.6</h2>
<p>In JSon based OCPP communication there is no header like in SOAP messages. 
Instead the ChargePointID is added to the URL when the web socket connection to 
the backend is established. This parameter is used for that. It is added to the 
configured backend URL automatically to identify the connecting charger towards
the backend.</p>

<h2>BootNotification use</h2>
<p>If no ChargePointSerialNumber (the manufacturer serial number of the 
charging station) is in the manufacturer parameters, this 
parameter is also used to fill this field of a OCPP BootNotification message.</p>

<h2>Master slave communication</h2>
<p>If two or more slave devices are connected, each Slave must identify itself 
to the master with its respective Connector ID added as a suffix. E.g. #2 or 
#005 should be appended to the ChargePointID. Please note that suffixes #, #0 
or #1 are reserved and cannot be used.</p>
